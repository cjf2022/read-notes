Getting a text editor is a program that allows you to edit text. 

text editors do different things, and are often based on personal  choice. Some editors feature word processors or code completion. Some  automatically close bracketed text. Some  work on certain operating systems and some are pre-installed on certain operating systems. It's a good idea to download a few try them out and see which one you dig more.

The command line or terminal  is where commands (keystrokes) entered are showing in text. A full line of commands will be before a prompt, which will shows up again after the commands are executed. Executing a command is when the computer runs  whatever action is typed in to it.

Basic navigation There are some commands used to navigate around the  Computer. The 1st  know is pwd, which stands for print working directory. This will show where you are currently located in your system. The command LS, which stands for "list", will show you what is  in your current location. Using brackets around text makes the command optional**** Using -l with LS makes it a big listing. Using /etc displays the contents of a file rather than the name. Paths display the root location of your file all the way to the location it's, with each location seperated by forward slashes (/). A "." can be used in place of your current directory (location) a ".." can be used in place of the preceeding or "parent" directory.

About files Everything inside linux is a file. No use of extensons for file names it  looks inside the file to determine what it is. Linux is case sensitive and spaces are used to seperate items. To put a space in a single item it must have a backslash () before the space. Also anything in "" is considered a single item. "hidden" files have  a . preceeding the file name. hidden files can be shown in a list by adding -a after ls
